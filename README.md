# Engineering-Computation-Lab-1
Compilation of the final project design and exercise files for Engineering Lab 1: Computation class (ENGR-102) in the College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University

## Final Project 
This is a collection of Python functions for handling, analyzing, and plotting scientific data, used for an engineering computation class project. Hereâ€™s what it does:

### Main Features:
1. **Data Handling and Plotting:**
   - Reads numeric data from files, extracts variable names/units, and stores the data.
   - Plots data as histograms or scatter plots, depending on the number of variables.
   - Allows linear interpolation between data points.

2. **Function Evaluation:**
   - Loads mathematical functions from a file.
   - Plots these functions over a specified range.
   - Numerically integrates a selected function over a given interval using the trapezoidal rule.

3. **Text File Analysis:**
   - Counts occurrences of specific words in text files.
   - Finds and reports lines containing certain strings.
   - Processes a batch of files to extract scientific measurements (e.g., fuel rod diameter, pitch, nuclear multiplication factor), calculates derived values (like moderator-to-fuel ratio), and plots relationships between these values.

**Typical Usage:**
- The file is meant for engineering/scientific students to automate data analysis and visualization tasks, especially those involving experimental data and result reporting.
- Some functions prompt for user input (for example, choosing variables for interpolation), while others are designed for batch processing or plotting.
